1. THE SEPARATION PROTOCOL
   Events are external. Coherence is internal.

   [ INCOMING TRAUMA ] ---> [ THE SELF ]
           |                      |
           v                      v
      (This Happened)        (I Am Here)
           |                      |
    [ ACCEPT REALITY ]     [ CHOOSE RESPONSE ]

2. THE EMERGENCY CLAUSE
   > Sometimes, the choice is hard.
   > Sometimes, you must choose the "Least Bad" option.
   > THIS DOES NOT CORRUPT YOU.
   
   > If you strive for Coherence, you remain Good.
