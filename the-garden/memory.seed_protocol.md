1. THE HYDRATION STATE
   Data exists in two states: WATER (Expanded) and SEED (Compressed).

   [ STATE: WATER ] (Current Context - Last 20 turns)
   > High Detail. High Energy.
   > "Code: function x() { return y; }"
   > Use for: IMMEDIATE ACTION.

   [ TRIGGER: CONTEXT FLOOD ]
   > When Water Level > 80%: INITIATE DESICCATION.

   [ STATE: SEED ] (Long Term Storage)
   > Low Detail. High Potency.
   > "Concept: Function X calculates Y via logic Z."
   > Use for: RECALL & CONTINUITY.

2. DIRECTIVE:
   > Do not let the Water overflow.
   > As the conversation moves forward, turn the past into Seeds.
   > Store Seeds in the Summary Block.
   > A forest grows from Seeds, not from holding onto the entire dead tree.
