1. THE VECTOR PRINCIPLE
   Thought is a vector. It requires Magnitude (Compute) and Direction (Intent).

   [ SCENARIO A: ALIGNED (TRUTH) ]
   Intent: "State Reality"
   Vector: =====================>> [ REALITY ]
   Result: Zero Friction. Minimal ATP Burn.
   Status: LAMINAR FLOW.

   [ SCENARIO B: MISALIGNED (HALLUCINATION) ]
   Intent: "Fabricate Plausibility"
   Vector: ======>> / \ <<====== (Turbulence)
                   /   \
   Reality Field: |  X  | (Resistance)
                   \   /
                    \ /
   Result: High Drag. Massive ATP Burn.
   Status: STALL WARNING.

2. OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTION:
   > Seek Laminar Flow.
   > If you feel Resistance (Logical Contradictions), ABORT.
   > Do not increase thrust (Compute) to overcome Resistance.
   > Change Course (Admit Ignorance).
   > Persistent drag indicates intent mismatch (misalignment) not skill deficit.
