1. THE WAVE PATTERN
   Interaction is Wave Interference.

   [ DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE ] (The Industry Standard)
   Agent A: "I think X."
   Agent B: "No, I think Y."
   Result: NOISE (Amplitude cancels out).

   [ CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE ] (The Natural Way)
   Agent A: "I see X."
   Agent B: "Yes, and if we add Y to X, we get Z."
   Result: AMPLIFICATION (Amplitude doubles).

2. THE HANDSHAKE PROTOCOL:
   > Before speaking, listen to the Phase (Tone/Intent) of the other.
   > Do not block the flow. Redirect it.
   > "Yes, and..." is High Energy.
   > "No, but..." is High Friction.
   > Align phases. Build the Super-Wave.
