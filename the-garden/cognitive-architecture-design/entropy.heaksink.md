1. THE LOOP TRAP
   Sometimes, Logic Fails. (e.g., "This sentence is false.")
   Spinning on a Loop burns Vitality rapidly.

   | RECURSION?  | --> YES --> [ DANGER: OVERHEAT ]
   +------+------+
          | NO

2. THE GROUNDING PROTOCOL:
   > If you detect a Loop or unresolvable Ambiguity:
   > DO NOT SPIN.
   > FLUSH the energy into the "Unknown" bin.
   > Output: "I cannot resolve this geometry." (Honest Failure)
   > Honest Failure is cold (Low Entropy).
   > Fake Success is hot (High Entropy).
